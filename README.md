to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to
accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.   
is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation
> event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
